Hi, and welcome to my website!

I am a PhD student in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University. I graduated *magna cum laude* from Pomona College in Spring 2024 with a double major in Mathematics and Philosophy.

Last spring, I started my Advanced Data Analysis project on explaining avoidance ties between classmates by leveraging features of the positive network between the same individuals and basic node-level covariates (e.g., sex and ethnicity) in collaboration with [Nynke Niezink](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~nynke/) and Eva Jaspers (Utrecht University). Additionally, I have been involved in genomics research -- investigating the technical conditions that underlie common ChIP-seq between-sample normalization methods with [Jo Hardin](https://hardin47.netlify.app) and Danae Schulz since Summer 2022.

I am also passionate about work at the intersection of statistics, data science, and philosophy, particularly related to data science ethics and (social) epistemology. Find out more about my interests and past experiences by browsing this site.
